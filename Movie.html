    <h3 style="font-size:x-large;" title="(1995)"> 1. Before Sunrise</h3>
       <p style="font-style: italic; text-indent: 20px;"> 
          I watched this exactly before sunrise, and it felt magical, poetic, and incredibly authentic; it felt so casually intimate the whole time I'm watching it. This film was set in the 90s, which makes the quality of the film itself, 
          felt so much more surreal and dream-like. This film is a great trilogy, but this is the best for me, it captures each of my senses, it felt so real, casual, and achievable, but in reality, this kind of connection is almost alway non-existent, an Intoxicating Love.

    <h3 style="font-size: x-large;" title="(1962)"> 2. Vivre Sa Vie</h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic; text-indent: 20px;"> 
          Written and directed by Jean-Luc Goddard, starring the great and beautiful Anna Karina. This is film is simple and straightforward, but it's philosophically complex and intriguing. I love this film because it tells about a woman who's passionate about her acting career, 
          only to end up as a prostitute, she question certain great things, but ends up dying from an illegal exchange that's out of her will. I love this film because it's highly experimental and personal, and with great cinematography in black and white that captures my heart.

    <h3 style="font-size: x-large;" title="(1989)"> 3. Dead Poets Society</h3>

          <q>We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. 
          But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, "O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?" Answer. 
          That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?</q></p>
       <p>Do I even have to explain why I love it and cherish it with my being?
